Sator Square Generator
======================
***

The original Sator Square is:  
  
        S A T O R  
        A R E P O  
        T E N E T  
        O P E R A  
        R O T A S  
  
More information on this square can be found in its [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square), but our primary interest is in the square's symmetry. From the article:
> The words may be read top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, left-to-right, or right-to-left. When read top-to-bottom and left-to-right, it forms the palindromic sentence "sator arepo tenet opera rotas". Its translation has been the subject of speculation with no clear consensus, but a common interpretation is "the farmer Arepo works a plough".

Given a list of words, this project aims to find all (or nearly all) Sator Squares that can be created from that list.
